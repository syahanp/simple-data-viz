#### https://simple-data-viz.vercel.app/

This simple project show how i tried [Visx](https://github.com/airbnb/visx), a low-level visualization primitive of [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) made for React.

Its really hard and bad practices to implement D3 in React world, because a lot of DOM manipulation happening under the hood.

So i found this really helpful. Still low level and un-opinionated, brings whatever data visualization to life.
